when I was doing the excel&R, I found that for some reason it does not let me filter any other column other than column one,, which is the CENSUS_YEAR column.
I found it strange but i still managed a way to sort out information of Ottawa-gatineau metropolitan area. 
However when I tried to create the chart table, there is no suggessted table popping out as the instruction said so. Therefore i creates my own. It took me longer than expected.
Later I updated all my Microsoft Software and then I went back and tried it again. It became a lot eaiser, for example there was no longer a barrier when I tried to import CSV whereas in the old version i have to turn on permissions and all so that the computer would allow the file and form would match.
When I proceed to voyant tools, it failed to open the page, i tires to open from a new tab mannualy, i also tried to restart the laptop, it still won't open.
