1. when I was doing the excel&R, I found that for some reason it does not let me filter any other column other than column one, which is the CENSUS_YEAR column.
2. I found it strange but i still managed a way to sort out information of Ottawa-gatineau metropolitan area. 
3. However when I tried to create the chart table, there is no suggessted table popping out as the instruction said so. Therefore i creates my own. It took me longer than expected.
4. Later I updated all my Microsoft Software and then I went back and tried it again. It became a lot eaiser, for example there was no longer a barrier when I tried to import CSV whereas in the old version i have to turn on permissions and all so that the computer would allow the file and form would match.
5. When I proceed to voyant tools, it failed to open the page, i tires to open from a new tab mannualy, i also tried to restart the laptop, it still won't open.
6. I googled the problem and it turned out that the setting of my laptop was stoping me from visiting the website, and I readjusted the setting and waited for a day, then I could visit the tools.
7. I was lost at finding corpus URL.
8. The trends box changes as i clicked different terms in the cirues box.
9. the theme of the text can be guessed from voyant tools based on the frequency certain words appear and where they appear.
